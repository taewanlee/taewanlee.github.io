In most cases, there was always a situation in which research requires us to learn information that was not previously known. In particular, algorithms commonly used in data analysis often use built-in functions already implemented in platforms (i.e., MATLAB and Python) with the idea of "use this algorithm in this case." However, can someone ask about an understanding of the algorithm? The answer is "NO." I would like to share my recent reading of Principle Component Analysis (PCA).

Before going into the main text, there is a quote that made me share my study direction with this post.

## Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues <b id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</b>

Imagine a big family dinner, where everybody starts asking you about PCA. First you explain it to **your great-grandmother**; then to **your grandmother**; then to **your mother**; then to **your spouse**; finally, to **your daughter** (who is a mathematician). Each time the next person is less of a layman. Here is how the conversation might go.
