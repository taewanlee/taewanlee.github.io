### Toward in-situ flaw detection in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing through layerwise imagery and machine learning

Snow et al. investigated the machine learning approach to process layerwise surface monitoring data to detect flaws in the LPBF. 6 different image states with different light conditions were used as input data to identify flaws in the additively manufactured parts. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are adapted to classify the existence of anomalies. The datasets are labeled with the X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data as ground truth. The input data were concatenated from various combinations of optical images. This work investigated the classification accuracy based on the size of defects. When the size of flaws is smaller than 100 $\mu m$, the classification accuracy is only reaching 68\%. However, the proposed approach shows an accuracy of 87.3\% for defects that have a size above 200 $\mu m$ in diameter. Here is the research question: Can we construct a multimodal learning approach with point cloud data and statistical features together to identify defects?
